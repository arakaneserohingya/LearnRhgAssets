With roots extending back more than two thousand years, the language reflects a layered history of migration, cultural contact, scholarship, and survival. Its modern form carries within it echoes of ancient Indo-Aryan dialects, medieval Islamic influence, and colonial-era transformations while maintaining its own distinctive phonology, grammar, and vocabulary."

These dialects descended from Old Indo-Aryan (Vedic Sanskrit) and evolved independently along the eastern Gangetic and coastal Bengal regions. Over centuries, they transformed into Middle Indo-Aryan forms known as Prakrits. Early dialects emerged along the coastal belt of the Bay of Bengal, encountering Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic languages."

For instance, the character 𐴁 represents the sound /b/ with a short vowel; when the Thaana is appended as in 𐴁𐴦, the syllable's nucleus is lengthened, producing /baː/ (a long 'aa' sound)."
